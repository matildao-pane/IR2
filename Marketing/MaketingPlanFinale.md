### 3.3 Perceptual Maps

![map1](./map1.png)
![map2](./map2.png)

### 3.4 SWOT Analysis

**Strengths**:
- Brand reputation
- High quality
- Top design, it is not a product to hide, is something to show to define your status
- Top sensors and software
- Constant commitment to innovation
- Relationships with leading global robotic institutes

**Weakness**:
- High price
- Only italian national store
- Final price depends also on suppliers costs
- Low variety of product choices
- Cost involved in developing the cleaning robots is high

**Opportunities**:
- Collaboration with European institutes
- Extra European market growth
- Start own supplier products production 
- Growing awareness about the health and benefits of vacuum cleaners
- Introduction of new robot vacuum concepts

**Threats**:
- Huge amount of well positioned competitors
- Imitators of the products
- Customers mental barriers againsts robots

### 3.5 Porter's Five Forces Model

**Barriers to entry**

- Absolute cost advantages
- Capital requirements.
- Brand identity/loyalty

The robot industry is unattractive to newcomers because of the cost advantage large-scale incumbents possess, the significant amount of capital a new firm would need, and the major established brands already in the industry.  

**Rivalry among competitors**

There is a strong rivalry since firms try to differentiate focusing on new features and finding new optimized mapping algorithms and more automatized products.

The competition forces each firm to invest in R&D to find the newest and best technology in order to maintain the visibility among different firms. 

**Substitute products**

There is not much of a threat from substitutes because in a digital age, customers are more and more relying on technology to run their lives. 

A substitute would be a classical vacuum cleaner that can cost less but the time and physical advantages of a robot are paramount.

**Bargaining power of buyers**

- High number of customers
- Low size of each order, one product last years.

Due to high number of competitors, customers have high bargaining power, but the quality and the reputation of the brand help the company to keep customers recognize our product as their first choice.

**Bargaining power of suppliers**

The IR2 suppliers are divided in two groups: the critical products suppliers and the leverage products suppliers.

The critical products suppliers have high power because the firm buys the sensors and customized part of the robots from those trusted few well specialized suppliers.

IR2 is very important for those suppliers because its their primary customer. 
The relationships between the firm and the supplier is well established, both IR2 and the suppliers would most likely not want to end their relationships, also because during the years, they established a partnership.

Other accessory and mechanical standard products will be supplied by other multiple suppliers. This leave a little power to this kind of suppliers, having IR2 the possibility to swap to a different cheaper competitor.

## 4. Customer Segmentation

**Geographics:**

The direct online retail is achieved trough the corporate site of the company: www.IR2.com 

Customers are also reached trough one of the largest national retail chain: Mediaworld. 

The price on both the channels is the same.

The choice of choosing only two distribution channels with the same price help the firm to avoid devaluation perception of the product and limit the perceived dispersion that a client can feel on different online and offline channels, with this strategy the firm can gain in fidelization over time trying to create an increasingly strong brand identity.

The most adopted channel is the offline store due to the necessity of the customers to see the object for real in action and to speak with someone that can help them in the decision before making a significant purchase.

### positioning

nicchia di mercato

In economia la nicchia è una parte di mercato che la concorrenza non ha ancora raggiunto, o che essa ha parzialmente occupato, ma in maniera tale da non venire incontro soddisfacentemente alla domanda.

Può consistere in una parte di clientela, oppure in un determinato tipo di prodotti. Le nicchie sono in genere degli spazi piccoli, spesso ricercati da piccole imprese. Dati i costi fissi e le dimensioni modeste di una nicchia di mercato, non è detto che la sua conquista comporti la necessaria redditività.


differenziazione
- unicità
-brand recognition
-high advertising
-low visibility of price(high prices)

# 4. Segmentation

OPZIONI: se metto anche il robot per i peli e ci punto a livello di ads, significa che come target aggiungo anche chi ha animali domestici,
altrimenti nn uso differrent products, non pongo l'accento sul fatto degli animali domestici e mi concentro su un'unica versione.
vediamo che ci dicono gli operational.

 segmentation strategy: the market is divided in customer group named segments that share some specifi charateristics. (shared needs, common interest, similar lifestyle, simila demographic profile)

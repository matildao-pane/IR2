# Finance
In this document we provide an overview of the finance structure of the IR2 company.

The 2019 operating income of the firm was 87 milions of euros.

## Budget

### Marketing and sales
Due to the high competition in our market, the company' strategy is to allocate an high percentage of our operative income to the marketing area. This is becuase we want to keep and reinforce our leadership in the market, maintaining an huge visibility respect to our competitors.

For the 2020, because of the incoming big project, we decided to don't increase the percenage allocated to the marketing in order to focus our strenghts in the project.

For these reasons the marketing budget allocated for the 2020 amounts to 10% of the operating income: 8,7 milions of euros.

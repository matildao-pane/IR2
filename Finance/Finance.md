Due to the high competition in our market, in the past the company' strategy was to allocate an high percentage of our operative income to the marketing area. This is becuase we wanted to improve and reinforce our leadership in the market, maintaining an huge visibility respect to our competitors.

During last years, once leadership in the market has been ensured, the funds allocated to the marketing area have been reduced. 

The marketing budget allocated for the 2020 amounts to 180000 euros.

# Finance
In this document we provide an overview of the finance structure of the IR2 company.

The 2019 operating income of the firm was 87 milions of euros.

## Budget

### Marketing and sales
Due to the high competition in our market, in the past the company' strategy was to allocate an high percentage of our operative income to the marketing area. This is becuase we wanted to improve and reinforce our leadership in the market, maintaining an huge visibility respect to our competitors.

During last years, once leadership in the market has been ensured, the funds allocated to the marketing area have been reduced. 

The marketing budget allocated for the 2020 amounts to 180000 euros.


### Purchasing (da fare)

The budget is created using a simple formula: the desired ending inventory, plus the cost of goods sold, minus the value of the beginning inventory. This equation gives you the total purchases budget. For example, if you want $10,000 in ending inventory and your cost of goods sold is around $3,000, add these two values and subtract the value of your beginning inventory from the $13,000 total. If the value of the beginning inventory is $2,000, for example, the amount if your total budget is $11,000.

The cost of goods sold is a collected sum of all products or services offered by the company in terms of the production value. The sum is a total of products costs plus the means to get it ready for sale. Some companies even break it down and explain how the cost is divided in terms of planning, production and testing, for example.


### Manufactoring (da fare)
A manufacturing budget is a set of three budgets that estimate the cost of direct materials, direct labor, and overhead for the number of units predicted to be produced in the production budget. In other words, the manufacturing budget estimates how much it will cost the company to produce the number of products included the production budget.

### Quality

We must guarantee the highest quality of our products, in order to satisfy every single customer. We only choose suppliers that comply with a certified standard quality (ISO 9001).

To ensure the quality also in our in-house assembly and testing processes, we reserve a budget devoted to the salary of some specialized professional figures, in duty of constantly checking every step of the two processes. 

numero di figure assunte x stipendio annuale = budget.

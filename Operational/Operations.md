## Introduction

### Our products

IR2 is a company that produces 2 kind of robots for a domestic usage:

- Dolly: the robot vacuum cleaner
- Molly: the mop robot

These robots are very similar each other in terms of architecture, design and mechanical/electronic components.

Currently on the market there are the line S, released some years ago and near to the end of it life cycle, and the line X, the the spearhead of the company.
Dolly and Molly of the line X are more powerful, more accurate and smarter.

Of course, the production focus is on the last line released, but we are still producing an huge amount of product of the line S.

## The activity

Our company has a factory based in Tuscany, in which about a hundred of people are employed. This factory deals only with the assembly phase, because the company has agreements with several firms for the supplies.
There both the two lines of robots are assembled.
Our production is characterized by medium volume and medium variability: because we have substantially 4 distinct products althought they are similar.

## Product Flow & Layout

Considering the previous statements, our company is in this situation:

So we have adopted an hybrid between batch environment and line process: the group technology.
The principle is that many problems are similar and by grouping similar problems, a single solution can be found to a set of problems, thus saving time and effort.
We can adopt this solution because there are some parts in the assembly phase that are very similar each other and use similar machinery, but we mantain a throughput higher than the batch process.

According to this, the manufactoring of our company is organized in a Cellular Layout.
The machines are grouped according to the process requirements for a set of similar items that require similar processing.
Workers in cellular layouts are cross-trained so that they can operate all the equipment within the cell and take responsibility for its output.
It's very often used in assembly phase.

### Production Details

Our machinery and our employees provide us to produce up to:

- 3077 Dolly X per month (about 750 weekly)
- 2963 Molly X per month (about 750 weekly)
- 1846 Dolly S per month (about 450 weekly)
- 1778 Molly S per month (about 450 weekly)

The production is organized in 2 shifts of 8 hours. This means that the overall hours of work in a month are 320, if we consider a month composed by 4 weeks.
About 45 employees work in each shift, in each of which there are:

- 14 people which deals with testing
- 5 people quality responsibles
- 2 people responsible of warehouse
- the others works on the cells

### Master Production Scheduling

### Weekly Production Planning

## Supply Chain

In order to assembly a robot we need the following mechanical and electronic components:

- Engine
- Wheels
- Frame
- Actuators (aspirator, mop)
- CPU
- Motherboard
- Sensors
- Body
- Accessories: bags, brush, ecc...
- Battery
- Power Supply

These components are provided by **external** suppliers for the following reason:

- suppliers have  research and know-how: the can provide us very high quality components

- future volume requirements are uncertain

- they can exploit better economy of scale

The assembly is full internal for two main reason:

- it's the way to guarantee an high quality of the product.

- we must install and configure the software by ourselves, in order to keep the secret.

We can divide all the suppliers in the following categories:

- Critical Products: the products that are customized for our company  (sensors, battery, body, power supply)

- Leverage Products: we need an high volume of these supplies but the suppliers are many.

For the first category there is one sourcing, we estabilished very detailed contracts with:

- a company that produces very accurate sensors, this company is at the forefront in this field.

- a company that produces durable battery and the power supply

-  

For the second category there are multiple sources:

- several companies that produce hardware components: they provides us the motherboards and the CPUs

- several companies that produce accessories with standard interfaces. (the brushes, the bags)

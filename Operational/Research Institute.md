# Research Institutes

Our company focuses heavily on research, we think costantly to the future. In order to pursue this scope, we have several agreements with different research institutes, specially in the field of the university.
These insitutes, as part of the agreement, do research on particular electronical or mechanical topics that are problematic for us. They organize teams that are in a very close collaboration with our R&D department.
Together, they find high-tech solution to our problem and produce prototypes, design and report of their work.
This agreement give us the advantage to be always ahead in the technology development and to have always the latest innovations.
On the other hand this collaboration is very suitable also for the research institutes:

- we contribute economically to their researches
- we consent to researchers to present their discoveries in our stands during the most important exhibitions in Italy and Europe.

# Inventory Managment

IR2 mantains three types of inventory:

- final product stock
- half-processed
- raw materials

## Final product stock

The forecasted rotation in our inventory for the year 2020 is the following:

|                            | Dolly X        | Molly X     | Dolly S     | Molly S     |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Medium Stock**           | 348            | 444         | 367         | 362         |
| **Medium Stock Value**     | 114380,64 €    | 141271,92 € | 98717,51 €  | 93931,15 €  |
| **Total Sales Forcasted**  | 32926          | 25888       | 13932       | 11347       |
| **Cost of sale**           | €‎  328,68     | €‎  318,18  | €‎  268,68  | €‎  259,18  |
| **Total Cost of The sale** | €‎  10.822.118 | €‎  8237044 | €‎  3743250 | €‎  2940915 |
| **Warehouse Rotation**     | 94,61          | 58,31       | 37,92       | 31,31       |
| **Average Stock**          | 4 days         | 6 days      | 10 days     | 12 days     |

For example a Dolly X, is on avarage only 4 days in the warehouse.
These values are quite positive because:

- obsolescence is avoided
- the inventory level is kept low

## Half-Processed Inventory

This inventory is kept very low because the productions cells are well balanced and a half-processed has to attend very few time between two different processes.

## Raw Materials

Our suppliers have an average lead time of a week.
There is a minimum order that is specified in the bill of materials.
Our supply-chain managment takes under control:

- forecasted demand at the beginning of the next week
- booked order at the beginning of the next week
- predicted inventory at the beginning of the next week

Based on these paramenters, they place the order minimum to comply the requests of the next week.
In this way, the inventory remains low.

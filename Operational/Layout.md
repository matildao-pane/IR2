# Layout

The manufactoring of our company is organized in a Cellular Layout.
The machines are grouped according to the process requirements for a set of similar items that require similar processing.
This type of layout is perfectly in agreement with our process flow based on Group Technology.
Workers in cellular layouts are cross-trained so that they can operate all the equipment within the cell and take responsibility for its output.
It's very often used in assembly phase.

Advantages:

- Cost. Cellular manufacturing provides for faster processing time, less material handling, less work-in-process inventory, and reduced setup time, all of which reduce costs.
- Flexibility. Cellular manufacturing allows for the production of small batches, which provides some degree of increased flexibility. This aspect is greatly enhanced with FMSs.
- Motivation. Since workers are cross-trained to run every machine in the cell, boredom is less of a factor. Also, since workers are responsible for their cells' output, more autonomy and job ownership is present.

It's a good solution for our company, for the following reasons:

- quite low variety
- medium volume

# Process Flow

How can we select the process type?
It's very helpful to answer the following questions.

## What are the physical requirements of the company's product

The physical requirements are mechanincal and electronical components
are provided to the company by a set of supplier firms.

## How similar to one another are the products that the company makes

The company produce two different products:

- robot vacuum cleaner
- robot mop

Each robot has 2 different version: the newer and the older version.

They are very similar in the materials needed and in the assembly.

## What are the company's production volumes

The company is able to produce 23 robots hourly.
The company is able to produce 368 robots daily.
The company is able to produce 8096 robots monthly.

## Where in the value chain does the customization take place

Assembly to order: products are assembled from components only once an order has been made.

## Our choice

The best process type selected by the company is an hybrid between batch environment and a line process.
The principle is that many problems are similar and by grouping similar problems, a single solution can be found to a set of problems, thus saving time and effort.
We can adopt this solution because there are some parts in the assembly phase that are very similar each other and use similar machinery.

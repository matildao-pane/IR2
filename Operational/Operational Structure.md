## Logistic and Warehouse

The factory in which we do the assembly is located in Italy.
In the same structure of the factory, there is the warehouse.
In this factory we receive the products from our suppliers, the final products is assembled and it's stocked in the warehouse. Periodically, a certain number of final product (robot + base accessory + power supply) is package and sent to the client.
Our warehouse is divided in two parts:

# Quality

## Introduction

IR2 is a company that has the quality of its products and manufactoring process as its main characteristic. IR2 improvements are focused on the customers needs.

What do our customers requires from our company?

Our customers want robot characterized by:

- high accuracy
- smartness
- durabilitiy

What is the source of the defets?

The defects could rise up from poor quality of input material or software tests that do not verify all possible cases.

We have to ensure:

- high quality for input material
- an intensive testing phase for the software
- close to 0 defects in the assembly phase

## Suppliers Quality Managment

For each supplier, in the phase of integration into the development process we discussed about:

- our quality requirements
- the quality assurance system of the supplier

We have estabilished all the phases, all the checks and the frequency of the inspections.
The inspections are more frequent for the suppliers considered "critical".
In the contract with the suppliers there is a detailed section about the penalities in the case of non-compliance with quality requirements.
In the contract with the suppliers, we have estabilished two type of sampling plan:

- single sampling for the supplier less reliable: the order is sent back if it has the defect level in a sample batch higher than a threshold extablisished by contract.

- double sampling for the most reliable suppliers: in this case, if a sample batch has the defect level higher than the threshold, another analysis, taking in consideration another sample batch, is done.

## Internal Quality Managment

Our company, and consequently all our suppliers, respects the ISO9001 standard.
According to this standard and to our phylosophy we don't limit ourselves to keep this level of quality, but we do a great effort to increase it more and more.

### Quality Assurance

In order to assure quality, our producs have been projected with a robust approach: they are projected to be kept under control from the statistical point of view.
It consists in finding the right combinations of parameter in the project phase in order to make the production process insensitive to variation or to the influences of disturbing factors as much as possible.
This approach provide us products with:

- higher quality level
- higher flexibility in terms of improvement
- less control costs

#### Quality Assurance Metrics

Our company uses the following quality assurance metrics:

- Defect Severity Index: defects are divided in category and to each one is associated a weight.
The index is equal to sum(n.defects_of_category * weight)/total of defects.
We take under control this number and when it increase rapidly we address it immediately.
- Defect Leakage

### Quality Control

The quality control is done in critical points of the production process by specialized employees.
They use checksheets and control charts and when a defect is found they investigate in the source using the 5-whys analysis.
At the end of each day of work, they write up a report that resumes all the controls of the day.
If one day, the report underlines an highlighted non-compliance, they are able to communicate with the managment to address the problem quickly acting on the source.

### Testing

Despite all our effort of quality assurance and control, it's also provided an intensive testing of the components and of the full product.
The test of the full product is very important to ensure that the behaviour of the robots is the expected one.
It has been elaborated for each type of robot a set of specific tests to cover all the possible problems that can happens.
When a behaviour not covered by the set of tests is found in any process phase, the test set is updated.
In this way there is a continous improvement of our testing phase.
Also for testing, there is suitable staff, responsible of doing physically the test and to write documentation.
In the case of robots that fail one or more test, the testing is repeated. In the case of another failure, the robots are put aside to be analyzed, in order to understand the problem.

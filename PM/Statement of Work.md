Currently, for our processes we use a custom version of the [HeliumV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeliumV) open-source ERP system. Moreover, we have a website, on which customers can buy our products and write aftersales reviews, and a mobile application through which customers can manage their robots and report problems. Therefore, it was decided to improve the managing of the output data coming from our r&d departement and integrate those data with customers feedbacks.

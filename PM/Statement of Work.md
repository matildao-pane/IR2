# Project Title:

<!--
Lee County Utilities (LCU) owns and operates the Pinewoods Water Treatment Plant and related public water supply wellfield south of Corkscrew Road approximately one mile east of Interstate I- 75. Currently, the wellfield consists of wells withdrawing water from traditional sources, the surficial and sandstone aquifers. Given the competition for fresh water resources and potential wetland impacts LCU decided that further development of raw water from traditional sources in this area was not feasible. Therefore, it was decided that further wellfield development would be raw water from the Lower Hawthorne aquifer, an alternative source. Lee County has initiated the construction of Pinewoods Lower Hawthorne Wells and RO Treatment Plant Phase I. In phase I the storage tank and RO building were completed. The next phase of this project will consist of completion of the 3.2 million gallons per day (MGD) Reverse Osmosis (RO) Water Treatment Plant (WTP) and the related Lower Hawthorne Wellfield.
